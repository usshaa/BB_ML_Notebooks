    "### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept Overview:**\n",
    "K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into \\( k \\) clusters. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Time Example:**\n",
    "Consider a retail business wanting to segment its customers based on purchasing behavior. By applying K-Means Clustering, the business can group customers into different clusters, such as high spenders, occasional buyers, and bargain hunters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematics Behind K-Means Clustering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Select \\( k \\) initial centroids randomly from the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. The nearest centroid is usually found using the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For a data point \\( x_i \\) and centroid \\( \\mu_j \\), the Euclidean distance is:\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\text{distance}(x_i, \\mu_j) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{m=1}^{M} (x_{im} - \\mu_{jm})^2}\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "3. **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each centroid.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For each centroid \\( \\mu_j \\):\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\mu_j = \\frac{1}{|C_j|} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_j} x_i\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   where \\( C_j \\) is the set of points assigned to centroid \\( j \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly, or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have the following data points representing customers based on their annual income and spending score:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\$\n",
    "\\{ (15, 39), (15, 81), (16, 6), (16, 77), (17, 40), (17, 76), (18, 6), (18, 94), (19, 3), (19, 72) \\}\n",
    "\\$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to cluster these data points into \\( k = 2 \\) clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Randomly select 2 centroids, e.g., \\( \\mu_1 = (15, 39) \\) and \\( \\mu_2 = (19, 72) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment Step**: Calculate the distance of each point from both centroids and assign them to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, for point \\( (15, 81) \\):\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\text{distance}((15, 81), (15, 39)) = \\sqrt{(15-15)^2 + (81-39)^2} = 42\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\text{distance}((15, 81), (19, 72)) = \\sqrt{(15-19)^2 + (81-72)^2} = 9.848\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since \\( 9.848 < 42 \\), assign \\( (15, 81) \\) to cluster with centroid \\( \\mu_2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Repeat for all points. Assume initial assignment results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Cluster 1: \\( \\{(15, 39), (16, 6), (17, 40), (18, 6), (19, 3)\\} \\)\n",
    "   - Cluster 2: \\( \\{(15, 81), (16, 77), (17, 76), (18, 94), (19, 72)\\} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroids of the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For Cluster 1:\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\mu_1 = \\left( \\frac{15+16+17+18+19}{5}, \\frac{39+6+40+6+3}{5} \\right) = (17, 18.8)\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "\n",
    "   For Cluster 2:\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "   \\mu_2 = \\left( \\frac{15+16+17+18+19}{5}, \\frac{81+77+76+94+72}{5} \\right) = (17, 80)\n",
    "   \\$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering is a simple yet powerful technique for grouping data points into clusters based on similarity. By understanding the underlying mathematics and steps involved, you can effectively apply K-Means to real-world problems, such as customer segmentation."
